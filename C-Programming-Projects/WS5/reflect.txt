// Workshop 5\
\
In this workshop I learned how to store different data types (int , double , float ) and how to declare an object by using structure type. Also, I learned how to access the members of an object of that type. \
\
I created structure struct Employee with some data in it ( age , id and salary) and I used switch(option) and different cases to manage the data in structure. In switch, while using case we must mention break; , otherwise the switch will continue executing all the cases in order , which we didn\'92t want to do. We needed to use specific case when needed that\'92s why we used break; to tell the program togo back and ask for case (option) input again. The default case was used to display an error message while choosing an  invalid menu option. I stored all the data for employee in struct amp array. Also, it was better to use different variables ( I and j ) for each case , because the data could be accessed wrong and my code wouldn\'92t work properly . \
\
We can use declaration to declare our structure globally ex. // Student.h in header file (separate file). \
We place course code .c in a header file and we can insert that header file\'92s code into the file that needs that information.}
